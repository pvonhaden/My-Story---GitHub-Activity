Spring break, a time to travel to warm places and enjoy the beach. 
There are always lots of fun memories that come from this time of year. 
This isn't the case every time. It was 1986 and we traveled down to Palm Springs Florida. 
It was a bright and sunny day and I was ready to hit the beach, until my plans were flipped upside down.

(Maxwell Kachelek) Literally my plans were flipped upside down, what was up is now down and what was down is now up.
This was extremely disorienting. I decided to come back to the hotel room and watch the news because this was super
odd. Turns out the local science office had an experiement that went horribly wrong but that they were fixing it
as soon as possible. All they needed to do was go to the computer and press ctrl+z a couple of times.
